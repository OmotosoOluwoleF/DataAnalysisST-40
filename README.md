# DataAnalysisST-40
This repository contains my learning journey, projects, and practical exercises from the Data Analysis scholarship program under the Seyi Tinubu @40 Initiative. 
It includes hands-on work with data cleaning, analysis, visualization, and insights generation using industry-relevant tools and techniques. 
The goal of this repository is to document progress, showcase skills, and apply data analysis to real-world problems.
